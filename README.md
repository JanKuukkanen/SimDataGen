Data generator for simulating water currents.

## Installation
Instructions for installing SimDataGen.

### Requirements
* Ubuntu linux
* Python 2.7.6
* A working cassandra database with usable roles
* Cloned SimDataGen repository

### Configuring the database access
Create the required database schema into your Cassandra database by running the file cassandra.cql found in the resources directory with cassandra's query language cqlsh:
```
Command to create the database schema: cqlsh cassandra [database ip] -u [username] -p [password] -f resources/cassandra.cql
```
Run installation_sdg.sh file as root:
```
sudo sh installation_sdg.sh
```
and insert the required database information, this creates a data_file with the database information that you gave which the program will use for accessing the database, you can later edit this file with a text editor if any information has been changed.

### Starting the program
Once you've configured the database, start the program by running the file start_sdg.sh.
